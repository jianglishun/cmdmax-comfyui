<br>Information Collection and Use
<br>Website and Online Content
<br>We collect information from you when you search for information, order products, request downloads, register for events or demos, or provide feedback. This helps us deliver the content you request, communicate with you, and better understand your interests. Additionally, it helps us improve our web experience, products, and services, and find others who may be interested.
<br>
<br>Your information is only shared as a hash, which means your details are irreversibly converted to a fixed-size string such as "0890f456684a70f1a9f1dbcee40c1fe847b76f338581a9a1d9202c76b1c175f4" (which is the SHA-256 hash of "CMDMAX"). Sharing information in hash form means that third-party ad providers can only identify you if they have the information we share and hash it to match the version of the hash we share. Sharing information in hash form is a way of identifying information that two parties have without sharing the information itself.
