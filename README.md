This project successfully solved various challenges in the field of computer image processing, including image cutting, synthesis, and filter application. In the past, these tasks often relied on professional image processing software such as Photoshop. However, with our innovation, the same function can now be achieved efficiently and conveniently through a professional online AI drawing platform. This progress marks a major leap in image processing technology and provides users with a more intuitive and easy-to-use operating experience.

We are developing an advanced online AI drawing platform that aims to provide an innovative alternative that makes traditional Photoshop native software redundant. Whatâ€™s unique about this platform is that by simply opening the website, users can use AI technology to automatically cut out images, combine images, apply filters, and more. Furthermore, it can also use AI to realize automated design of workflows, greatly improving work efficiency. The launch of this professional-grade online AI drawing platform will completely change the traditional, complex and time-consuming image processing methods. Even users who are unfamiliar with professional software such as Photoshop can easily process various images and enjoy a simple and intuitive image editing experience.
In the development of our AI projects, we use Pytorch ROCm 6.0, an open source machine learning library based on Python. It provides an efficient and flexible development environment for our projects. The online AI drawing platform we launched is characterized by its convenience, high efficiency and automated functions. Users can easily complete tasks such as cutout, image synthesis, and application of filters without relying on traditional client software such as Photoshop. Our project development direction has shifted from using NVIDIA hardware and the CUDA 12.1 framework to using AMD AI hardware and the ROCm 6.0 framework. This shift enables us to design and develop our online AI drawing platform more efficiently and achieve better performance.
We have launched a powerful Android app, AI PixelPro, an artificial intelligence drawing assistant. This app can not only connect to remote servers, but also run on local PCs. Just make sure your local PC is equipped with AMD or NVIDIA GPU and install the compiled version of ComfyUI we provide, and you can easily achieve efficient drawing.
1. Powerful image generation model:Stable Diffusion 3 Medium support: Adopting the advanced Stable Diffusion 3 Medium image generation model, it can generate high-resolution, realistic and complex images. The model combines deep learning and probabilistic programming to ensure the high quality and diversity of the generated images.
2. Rich tags and preset tags:Tag collection and classification: The application contains more than 3,000 tags covering a variety of topics and concepts. In addition, 30 sets of preset tags are provided, and users can quickly select and combine tags as needed to generate inspiring creative prompts.
3. Keyword library and intelligent prompt word generation:Rich keyword support: Built-in 100,000 keywords support users to quickly find relevant prompt words through fuzzy queries, helping users to express their creative needs more accurately.AI drawing prompt word generation: Using a large language model, users only need to simply describe the image features or scenes they want, and the application can generate creative and rich drawing prompt words to provide inspiration support and direction.
4. Data privacy protection and local storage:Local image storage: All generated images are automatically saved on the user's local device to ensure user data privacy security.
5. ComfyUI client and local GPU support:LAN ComfyUI client: Android client supports connecting to local LAN ComfyUI client, users can add local GPU, use NVIDIA or AMD graphics card to accelerate image generation.Simple operation experience: Provide the latest ComfyUI client compiled distribution, support Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22 systems, no complex settings, and use it in a similar way to popular image editing software such as Photoshop.Users use local GPU to accelerate image generation and data security.
6. Optimize image generation speed and quality:Extreme generation experience: Through optimization, AI drawing speed can complete a 512-pixel image in as fast as 2 seconds, ensuring that users can quickly obtain the desired creative results.
7. User participation and reward mechanism:Contribution points system: Users participate in contributing accurate prompts and feedback, and can obtain system reward points to encourage users to actively participate in product improvement and community building.
